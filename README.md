We have made a Counselling application which is a subpart of our Anti Smoking app(Fumigan) made using Flutter, Dart and Firebase.
We will be implementing the Chatbox and the counselling feature inside Fumigan along with the following features-

1)Games that distract you from cravings, plus challenges for you and your friends so that you can motivate each other to quit smoking. For example- Memory Game

2)Personal Diary to keep notes and reminders to quit smoking

3)70-100 ex-smoker achievements and quotes to keep you motivated and a strong ex-smoker community for your newfound health improvements.

4)Insights into craving patterns and graphs to monitor your overall progression. 

5)Level based challenging system to inform how much money you’re saving, and how much life you’ve regained. 
There’s also a timeline that shows you how quickly you start enjoying health benefits.

6) This app uses behavioral modification tools based on the ideas behind Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

We are working on this idea because addictive smokin is a recent trend and 
Smoking causes about 90% of all lung cancer deaths. More women die from lung cancer each year than from breast cancer.
It is responsible for 80% deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leading to the risk of risk of tuberculosis, 
certain eye diseases, and immune system problems, including rheumatoid arthritis.

since Cigarette smoking increases the risk of death from all causes in men and women.
We have made an Anti Smoking application.
